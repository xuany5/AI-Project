Issue: 
  Most consumers in Australia are vulnerable to misleading and deceptive conduct by suppliers. Although there are statutes and regulatory bodies in place, it is both tedious and complex for ordinary consumers to navigate around the regulations. A robust and healthy market needs consumers who know their rights and are willing to protect their rights. There is a demand for a simpler and more accessible way for consumers to keep themselves informed about their rights.

Solution: 
  Although there are many ways that can keep consumers informed such as distributing brochures or posting videos, these methods often fail to address specific questions efficiently. AI can provide a business solution efficiently through machine learning. Through a chat bot, consumers can type in their queries and get answers immediately instead of reading through the whole statutes or risking clicking into outdated or irrelevant materials. 

Approach: 
(1) Project planning:
  Firstly, the issue above is considered. AI is able to provide a fairly efficient tool in meeting the business requirement. 

(2) Data collection:
  The main source is the Australian Consumer Law. It covers a wide range of issues that consumers may face in their daily actitivities. The data is unstructured as they are contained in a Word document. They are categorical data. 

(3) Model training:
  The appropriate model in this situation is deep learning model. A bot was trained to identify the key issue in the questions through language understanding and respond based on the dataset. The model will be asked multiples times to test its accuracy in responding to consumers. THe model will be running on the QnA maker. It is better to give users an accurate and general answer rather than a concise but irrelevant answer.

(4) Deployment:
  It is essential to keep monitoring the performance of chat bot, and gather feeback from users. This solution is also scalable as the input of data is generally quicker than other methods.
